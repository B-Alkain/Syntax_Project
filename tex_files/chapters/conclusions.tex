\section{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Our HMM edges the \texttt{nltk} HMM in both languages: +3.6 test points in Basque (0.8560 vs. 0.8189) and +0.15 in Catalan (0.9445 vs. 0.9430), with dev gains of 0.8622 vs. 0.8258 (EU) and 0.9477 vs. 0.9453 (CA).
  \item Against backoff n-gram taggers, Basque trigram hits 0.866 (slightly above our HMM 0.8560 and well above \texttt{nltk} 0.8189); in Catalan the HMMs lead over n-grams (0.9445/0.9430 vs. 0.935). Joint modeling of transitions and emissions yields a clear advantage in CA and is on par in EU.
  \item Language matters: Basque shows larger train\(\rightarrow\)dev/test drops (0.9693\(\rightarrow\)0.8622\(\rightarrow\)0.8560) than Catalan (0.9761\(\rightarrow\)0.9477\(\rightarrow\)0.9445), reflecting the impact of agglutinative morphology on \(p(x\mid y)\) sparsity.
  \item Tag-wise (Basque test): PUNCT 1.000, PART 0.997, and CCONJ 0.986 lead; open classes dip (NOUN 0.853, VERB 0.823, PROPN 0.662) and rare tags drop sharply (INTJ 0.125, X 0.435, SCONJ 0.000). Handling OOVs/subword features would likely lift NOUN/VERB/PROPN.
  \item Sequential probability: the joint probability for a Basque example was \(4.29\\times 10^{-13}\), a reasonable scale for long sequences; random samples and Viterbi paths confirm the model favors well-formed tag orders.
\end{itemize}
